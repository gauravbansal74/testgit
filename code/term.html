By using Miljul.in service, you are agreeing to these terms of service. Please read the document fully and Email us at <a href=mailto:vinod@miljul.in onclick="javascript:window.open('mailto:vinod@miljul.in', 'mail');event.preventDefault()">vinod@miljul.in</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p></h1></article><article><h3>Service Description</h3><p>Miljul.in is a web based video conference service that allows video calls with others by having the participants use the unique URL for each meeting in the browser window. Accessing the same unique URL will make the participants appear in the same room where you can talk to each other with transmitted video, voice and text chat. You do not have to install any software or plugins to use Miljul.in. Currently, you also do not have to register or log in to use the service.</p><p>Video and audio in Miljul.in is only seen by the participants in the room at the time of the transmission during a video conference session. The content is not shared with anyone who is not in the room. When people enter a room you are present in, you can see them in the room. As the URL includes a randomly generated alphanumeric, sharing the URL via email or any messaging application is the only way to invite someone into the room.</p><p>Chat messages sent by participants can be seen by people who are in the room when the message is sent and by people who enter the room during the same chat session. A session ends when there are no people in a room any more. At this time, all messages sent in the chat session will be deleted and can no longer be viewed by anyone.</p><p>Screen sharing can be done by any of the participants in a video conference. Note that screen sharing only works on Google Chrome browser and it requires you to have appropriate settings for the traffic flow in a secure manner (https).</p><p>Miljul.in retains the right to create limits on use and storage at its sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p></article><article><h3>Privacy Policy</h3><p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Miljul Softtech Private Limited collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the https://miljul.in website ("Site").
